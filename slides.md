# What is React?

* React is component based JavaScript UI Framework.
* React takes a composition approach to create reusable UI components.
* A component has an idea of a state or prop. A state represents a components data, primitive values, and react elements/functions.

---

### What about Inheritance??
>At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we havenâ€™t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

---

#### What do we love about it?
 ES6 SYNTAX
* Template Strings
 ```
    `Hello ${user.name}`
 ```    
* Fat Arrow Functions
 ```
    => () {return true}
 ``` 
* Literals: Let and Const

# JSX
* Html Literals

# What is Redux?

#### Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

- Why would we use redux?
    * It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).
    * The state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.

---

#### Redux and it's opinions

* Redux provides the idea of:
    * Global Store, Actions and a Reducer
* The Global Store is a immutable object of the entire application.
* Actions specify the mutations that need to occur to the Store.
* Reducers decides what and how a specific Action transforms the entire applications state.

---

#### Why do we think its cool?

* Powerful Developer Tools
    * The state of you application is now held accountable by Actions.
    * You can trace or debug by replicating those actions.
    * We can now make better and more complex choices in our application.
